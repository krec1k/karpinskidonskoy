During WW2 he was a soldier of Batalion Zośka of Polish Home Army, awarded multiple times with a Cross of Valour. Among the others he took a part in Operation Kutschera (intelligence) and Warsaw Uprising when he was heavily wounded. Later he became a developer of one of the first machine learning algorithms, techniques for character and image recognition. After receiving a UNESCO award in 1960, he studied for 2 years at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. In 1971 he designed of one of the first minicomputers, the K-202. Because of the policy on computer development in the People\'s Republic of Poland, belonging to the Comecon that time, K-202 was never mass-produced.
